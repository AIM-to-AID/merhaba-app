# App First Draft
Note: name to be changed

This is the repo for an app being made for the congressional app challenge.
It is targeted for Muslim refugees in the United States.

## Setup

To setup is simple thanks to the wondurful tools expo go.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm i expo`
3. Copy the contents of `./src/env-example.js` into a new file `./src/env.js` (Contact me for the actual keys although it will still run regardless, just missing some features)
4. Run `npx expo start`
5. Follow the instructions that appear in the terminal (You may need to have a device and download the expo go app)

This should give the current build and set anyone up for development and testing.
